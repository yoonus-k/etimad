# Debug files

This folder contains HTML snapshots and debug artifacts used to inspect scraping and download flows.

Typical files:

- `attachments_response.html` — raw attachment endpoint HTML
- `etimad_homepage.html` — cached homepage snapshot
- `etimad_login_page.html` — cached login page snapshot

Safe to remove; these will be regenerated during debug sessions.
